## Closing the Loop

FieldOps aims to provide seamless data flow from the field to the back
office. To compete with mature platforms, the following integrations and
workflows will be prioritized:

1. **Accounting Sync** – Export approved timesheets, expenses and
   invoices to cloud accounting systems. Start with CSV downloads then
   optional API-based sync for QuickBooks or Tally users.
2. **Procurement Workflow** – Allow supervisors to raise material
   requests from the mobile app. Admins approve and convert these into
   purchase orders. Delivery confirmations update inventory in real time.
3. **Payroll Automation** – Combine GPS attendance with task
   completions to generate payroll-ready reports. Output the data in a
   standard format for existing payroll software.
4. **Client Transparency** – Generate shareable progress reports with
   photos and status updates so owners can track work without needing a
   separate login.

## Key Use Cases

1. **Daily Field Reporting**
   - Workers log in with GPS verification and receive tasks.
   - They upload photos/videos as proof of completion.
   - Supervisors see real-time status and approve work.

2. **Equipment & Material Tracking**
   - Supervisors scan a QR code on materials when received.
   - The system updates stock levels and alerts the office when
     thresholds are low.

3. **Compliance Checks**
   - AI flows analyse uploaded media and GPS logs for anomalies.
   - Issues trigger notifications to supervisors for quick resolution.

4. **Payroll Preparation**
   - Approved task hours and attendance feed a payroll export.
   - Admins review totals and push them to their accounting tool.

## Roadmap to a Full Solution

1. **Short Term**
   - Polish existing task and attendance flows.
   - Create simple CSV exports for accounting and payroll.
   - Improve documentation and in-app guidance.

2. **Medium Term**
   - Implement procurement and material approval processes.
   - Add subcontractor management and mobile work orders.
   - Offer API endpoints for external integrations.

3. **Long Term**
   - Provide advanced analytics including cost vs. budget tracking.
   - Introduce client-facing portals for progress transparency.
   - Build optional integrations with ERP and BIM tools.

FieldOps will focus on simplicity and quick adoption while gradually
adding modules that connect site activity to financial and operational
systems. This iterative approach ensures the product remains usable for
small teams yet scales to the needs of larger contractors.
